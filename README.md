# docker-aspirant

Welcome to the application process for Trusted Shops Developer enrollees! This project contains a docker-compose environment, 
within you can do all tasks that you are commissioned with.

## Getting started

1. First, install docker (and docker-compose, on linux environments)
  - https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=installation
2. Clone this repository where-ever you like to.
3. Open a terminal and run `docker-compose up -d`
4. You should now have a working environment, and can start working.

To use tools and more, we provided you with some stuff here:

``` docker exec -it tsas-tools bash```

This connects you to the shell of a docker-container, ready to use with NodeJS, Angular, MySQL CLI and many more.
You can also use tools you like, for sure.

## Nice to know:
### Commands

**Note:** The commands are only available inside the workspace directory, and relative to root:

- Angular CLI: `docker exec -it tsas-tools ng`, and desired arguments, 

  e.g. `docker exec -it tsas-tools ng new`
- NodeJs: 
   `docker exec -it tsas-tools node` and desired arguments.,

  e.g. `docker exec -it tsas-tools node hello-world.js`

- Grunt: `docker exec -it tsas-tools grunt` and desired arguments

  e.g. `docker exec -it tsas-tools grunt default`

- MySQL Client
  `docker exec -it tsas-tools mysql` and desired arguments

  e.g. `docker exec -it tsas-tools mysql -uroot -pTru5t€d -htsas-db`

### Locations:

- **./public_html** - This directory is served by nginx. You can reach it through the nginx's address stated below.
  -  Save static files here (HTML, CSS, Images, other assets)
  -  Save PHP files here.
- **./workspace** - Maps to the /root/ home directory of all possible containers, except database and php.
  - Save everything private here.
  - You can write node.js apps here, and run it with `docker exec -it tsas-tools node [MYFILE]`
  - You can create angular-apps in here (**change mytask to whatever name you like**):
      - Setup the project
        ```
        # Create
        docker exec -it tsas-tools ng new --name mytask --routing --style scss --skip-tests --skip-git

        # Configure output for NGINX
        docker exec -w /root/mytask -it tsas-tools ng config "projects.mytask.architect.build.options.outputPath" "/var/www/html/mytask"
        docker exec -w /root/mytask -it tsas-tools ng config "projects.mytask.architect.build.options.baseHref" "/mytask/"
        docker exec -w /root/mytask -it tsas-tools ng config "projects.mytask.architect.build.options.deployUrl" "/mytask/"

        # Start build and watch source code
        docker exec -w /root/mytask -it tsas-tools yarn run build --watch
        ```
      - http://localhost:9980/mytask
- **./wordpress** - When booting the environment, this directory contains all wordpress stuff.
  - Use it for wordpress development.

Digging deeper:
- **./.docker** - nothing relevant for you, just keeps you served with tools.
- **./.docker/nginx** - nginx configuration
- **./.docker/databases** - Basic database dumps, used during first creation of your docker container.
